# AKTU Student Information Scraper
=====================================

## Overview

This project is a web scraper designed to extract student information from the Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) website. The scraper uses a combination of HTTP requests and HTML parsing to retrieve student data, including roll numbers, names, and dates of birth.

## Features

* **Efficient Data Retrieval**: The scraper uses a optimized algorithm to retrieve student data, minimizing the number of HTTP requests and reducing the load on the AKTU website.
* **Flexible Data Extraction**: The scraper can extract a wide range of student data, including roll numbers, names, and dates of birth.
* **Error Handling**: The scraper includes robust error handling to ensure that it can recover from common errors, such as network failures and HTML parsing errors.
* **Modular Design**: The scraper is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to add new features and modify existing ones.

## Technical Details

* **Programming Language**: The scraper is written in JavaScript using the Node.js runtime environment.
* **Dependencies**: The scraper uses the following dependencies:
	+ `axios` for making HTTP requests
	+ `cheerio` for parsing HTML
	+ `qs` for handling URL query strings

## Installation

To use the scraper, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* `axios`: `npm install axios`
* `cheerio`: `npm install cheerio`
* `qs`: `npm install qs`

## Usage

To use the scraper, simply clone the repository and run the following command:
```bash
node main.js
```
This will start the scraper and begin extracting student data from the AKTU website.

## Example Output

The scraper produces a JSON output containing the extracted student data. Here's an example of what the output might look like:
```json
[
  {
    "rollNumber": "2200140200009",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "dob": "1995-01-01"
  },
  {
    "rollNumber": "2300140000026",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "dob": "1996-02-02"
  }
]
```
## Future Development

There are several ways to improve the scraper, including:

* **Adding support for additional data fields**: The scraper currently only extracts roll numbers, names, and dates of birth. Adding support for additional data fields, such as addresses and phone numbers, could make the scraper more useful.
* **Improving error handling**: While the scraper includes robust error handling, there may be additional errors that could be handled more elegantly.
* **Optimizing performance**: The scraper could be optimized for performance by using more efficient algorithms or by parallelizing the data extraction process.
